# Decisions

Record a decision when it changes the work other people or agents should do. Keep entries brief.

## Template

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD — Decision title

**Decision:** What we chose.

**Why:** The evidence or trade-off behind it.

**Consequences:** What this enables, limits, or changes next.
```

## 2026-09-12 — Use lightweight shared project documentation

**Decision:** Maintain the documents in `docs/` and use `CLAUDE.md` as the agent-facing operating guide.

**Why:** The team needs a fast way to align people and agents before a project idea exists.

**Consequences:** Update the relevant document when a shared product, design, technical, or demo decision becomes stable.

## 2026-09-12 — Start with Vite, React, and TypeScript

**Decision:** Use a minimal Vite-powered React application with TypeScript and ESLint.

**Why:** It provides a fast, familiar web-demo foundation while keeping the initial dependency surface small.

**Consequences:** The team can start with `npm run dev`; add routing, APIs, UI libraries, and tests only when the chosen idea requires them.
